## Python 3.5 (Not tested on Python 2!) ##

How to execute program:
- Make sure Python 3.5 or later is installed on test machine. Code MIGHT run on Python 2 but is designed for 3.
- Run server.py through Python IDLE terminal, then run client.py the same way. The code should also work for
  command line arguments as described in the assignment.
- When finished, call "quit" in client program, then exit out from server.
